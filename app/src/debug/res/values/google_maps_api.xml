    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    de.hdmstuttgart.voidme.ui.maptest

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    DA:CE:FD:AB:0A:C7:BD:C2:A2:E7:CC:50:F0:BE:38:A7:19:45:EA:26

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:

    string in this file.

                 The API key for Google Maps-based APIs is defined as a string resource.
                 (See the file "res/values/google_maps_api.xml").
                 Note that the API key is linked to the encryption key used to sign the APK.
                 You need a different API key for each encryption key, including the release key that is used to
                 sign the APK for publishing.
                 You can define the keys for the debug and release targets in src/debug/ and src/release/.
